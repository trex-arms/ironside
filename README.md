# Ironside Files

The [T. Rex Arms Ironside Holster](https://www.trex-arms.com/product-category/holster-categories/Ironside/) is a simple and elegant OWB holster from T.Rex Arms, complete with a full array of magazine carriers. This repository contains resources that should be enough for anyone to design, manufacture, and sell their additional Ironside beltloops and mounting accessories, or use these as a starting point for their own belt attachments. These files are licensed under the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). Injected molded parts are available from the T.Rex site, but our tests have shown similar strength when these models are printed out of MJF nylon. 

## Belt Loops
3D meshes of the [1.5" and 1.7" Belt Loops](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/Ironside-Belt-Loop-Pair/) are included, as well as PDF version of a 2D print. The Ironside belt loops are a simple and straightforward way to attach holsters or cases to belts. These can be easily adapted to different sizes of belts, different attachment points, or different angles. This design should be a good starting point for experiments with different textures to grip the belt, or other modifications.

## Bridge Connector
In order to connect multiple magazine carrier together, we manufactured [this simple bridge](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/Ironside-Carrier-Connector/). It has the same 1" hole pattern of most T.Rex Arms accessories, and gentle bend to accommodate most body types. Again, this STL file should be a great starting point for any changes to accommodate different hole patters, different angles, or additional features.
